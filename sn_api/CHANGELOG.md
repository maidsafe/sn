### New Features

 - <csr-id-5c8b1f50d1bf346d45bd2a9faf92bbf33cb448da/> client retry spend on unknown section key
   When the client receives an unknown section key error, it will obtain the proof chain and SAP for
   the unknown section and resubmit the request with this additional information.
   
   There is no automated client test for this scenario. We went to great lengths to try, but it proved
   not worth the effort. It was too difficult to modify the network knowledge with a fake section and
   still have things function correctly. The scenario is unit tested on the node side, and we done
   enough testing to know that the retry loop does what's intended.
   
   There are a few misc changes along with this commit:
   
   * Debugging message to indicate a spend request being processed correctly, which proved useful when
   trying to get the automated test working.
* Remove the current section key from the unknown section key error. It's not necessary to include
     this.
* When running the baby fleming network with the Makefile, include log messages from `sn_interface`.
* Fix up git-based references to `sn_dbc` crate.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8855c50b2e47be4298220c9e1f79a57403fd4ac0/> add upload limit to cli cfg
 - <csr-id-fa82955cd4e8ad82372089fd08e11e19dcaee42b/> add upload limit to cli cfg
 - <csr-id-92b858783208930f2ce6af55fa2aab28e83218ba/> increment tokens balance in test-DBCs to fix CLI wallet test
 - <csr-id-681d973cca17264edee7139beb02b6082df34b48/> fix api doctests

### Other

 - <csr-id-e58d19d10d8cf4817f066942e1dbbeffbca740ce/> reenable cli tests

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-6bc0892e50dddbda393eb37abac44e2bf7e626eb/> removing query retrying loops and sleeps in sn-api/sn-client tests
 - <csr-id-10c2420505b85914eb7518c48a3951a5402331cf/> verify each Chunk individually in the `upload_and_verify` API
   - This shouldn't only reduce the amount of memory used when uploading large files,
   but it shall also be more precise as to when a Chunk is ready for verification after
   uploading it, and which chunk specifically failed the verification.
   - Sending a DataCmd now is not retried but only make sure it returns within
   the configured cmd timeout window.
   - Using `expect()` in some client file tests to make sure Rust return useful info when errors
   occur, there is an issue with Rust test when Err is returned not showing enough failure info.
 - <csr-id-1152b2764e955edd80fb33921a8d8fe52654a896/> get public commitments from sn_dbc
   The code for retrieving and validating the public commitments was moved out to the sn_dbc crate.
   
   It's needed for both the spend request and test setup code which is going to be referenced in both
   `sn_node` and `sn_client`.
   
   Also fixed a clippy error in `SectionTree::get_signed_by_key`.

### Test

 - <csr-id-ff59202d1374c7e5dcc570d50ed8b399fafe488d/> feature-gated send_query API to verify data is stored in all replicas for each query
   - Introducing a new `check-replicas` feature to sn_client (as well as sn_api and CLI), which switches
   the `Client::send_query` API behavior to send the query to all Adults replicas and it expects a
   valid response from all of them instead of from just one.
   - Running sn_client, sn_api, and CLI tests in CI with new `check-replicas` feature enabled to verify
   data was stored in all Adults replicas.
   - With `check-replicas` feature enabled, query responses from all Adults replicas are also compared
   to verify they are all the same.
 - <csr-id-905b8d8ed5652c50aac8c381b3c000efcad5de74/> add retry loop patterns to some nrs tests

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bdf50e7ad1214ef4bb48c0a12db8a7700193bb2a/> removing unused Error types and adding context info to a couple of them
 - <csr-id-a973b62a8ef48acc92af8735e7e7bcac94e0092f/> removing op id from query response
   - Use the query msg id to generate the operation id to track the response from Adults
   - Remove peers from pending data queries when response was obtained from Adults
   - Removing correlation id from SystemMsg node query/response
   - Redefine system::NodeQueryResponse type just as an alias to data::QueryResponse

### New Features

 - <csr-id-341306acd1e16290fe9a8ec676499feec8ef7639/> extend cli wallet deposit for owned dbcs
   The CLI is now extended to support the deposit of owned DBCs.
   
   The `deposit` command will check if the supplied DBC is owned, and if it is, it will check to see if
   the `--secret-key` argument is present and use that. If that argument isn't present, it will attempt
   to use the secret key that's configured for use with the CLI, i.e., the `keys create --for-cli`
   command.
   
   The `reissue` command was also extended to provide an `--owned` flag, which when used, will reissue
   an owned DBC using the public key configured for use with the CLI. This argument is mutually
   exclusive with the `--public-key` argument, which will reissue the DBC using a specified key.
   
   So we could offer the user a suggestion when a supplied secret key didn't match, this also involved
   making a little extension to the API, to return a specific type of error. We will need to modify
   `sn_dbc` to return a specific error type for this too, so we can avoid checking the string content
   of the error message, but this will be covered on a separate PR.

   `sn_dbc` to return a specific error type for this too, so we can avoid checking the string content
   of the error message, but this will be covered on a separate PR.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5577695b5d3291c46cd475df8c0933a067b4cfc5/> serialize to bls keys in util functions
   Utility functions were recently added to the API for serializing to the `Keypair` type. This was
   changed to serialize directly to BLS to make it easier for the CLI to deal directly with BLS keys.
   Soon we will be refactoring the `Keypair` type to have a different use case and things like
   `sn_client` would be refactored to directly work with BLS keys. This is a little step in that
   direction.
   
   There was a utility function added to `sn_interface` to create a `Keypair` from a hex-based BLS key
   because we still need to use the `Keypair` at this point in time.

 - <csr-id-4c6e6cff474d306e6632f004c6cf05729c7ced16/> add public key argument for owned dbcs
   The `wallet reissue` command now has an additional optional argument, `--public-key`, which allows
   the user to reissue a DBC to be owned by the holder of that public key. The key should be BLS
   hex-encoded.
   
   The `wallet deposit` command will now require extension to provide the secret key when depositing an
   owned DBC. This will be done as a separate piece of work.
   
   Some additional changes were made in support or to tidy CLI-related code:
   * The conversion of DBCs to/from hex were removed from the CLI since this is now done on the `Dbc`
   type.
* A CLI test that existed to test the above conversion code was removed since it's no longer
     necessary.
* The naming scheme for the CLI wallet tests were elaborated and the redundant "calling_safe"
     prefixes were removed.
* The conversion of DBCs to/from hex were removed from the CLI since this is now done on the `Dbc`

   we want caret, which is implicit frm v 1

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-a45a3bda7044f07b6ecd99569ec4c043330d7160/> Improve query handling, keep peers on DataNotFound
   Previously if we had DataNotFound, any waiting peers are not requeued.
   So this means that one bogus adult can effectively fail a query which
   might otherwise succeed.
   
   In doing so, we need to always resend queries to adults if clients retry
   as otherwise they may remain queued but wont actually requery adults
   ever again.
   
   This appears to improve test time, even after reducing the RETRY_COUNT
   on messages.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-eaeca4223c4e35884bfd1129832b890e70b6ef5e/> upgrade to new version of qjsonrpc
   The `sn_api` crate is updated to use the new version of `qjsonrpc`.
   
   The `qjsonrpc` library had breaking changes to pass cert and key paths rather than passing a
   directory that was assumed to contain them. This change caused `sn_api` to do the same. There is an
   unfortunate consequence here: to use `SafeAuthdClient` you need to pass a certificate, along with
   another certificate and a private key for starting an endpoint that deals with notifications for
   approving authentication requests. The previous setup was just making the assumption that both keys
   and certificates were in the same directory. Since this change led to an odd interface for
   `SafeAuthdClient` we had some discussion around using a different mechanism for notifications, but
   we decided to come back to it later with a wider review.
   
   The API change forced an update to some code in the CLI, even though the authd system isn't really
   being used at the moment. The self-signed certificates are now being generated in the CLI. Since the
   CLI is a specific application, I think this is a more appropriate place for that to happen.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-f558b5c60df64dd349158a327bec945321937cf3/> make nrs url validation private
   We made URL validation public to share code during NRS resolution, but there's no need for
   validation during resolution because the URLs have already been validated at the point of
   association.
   
   Also fix some clippy warnings.

### Other

 - <csr-id-b9ceb229091ca29f5dcc675d66a0d9ff46a60427/> update nrs tests to use helper
   The helper was moved into the test_helpers module and renamed to TestDataFilesContainer, since this
   seems more accurate.
   
   A test was added for retrieving a topname link. This is arguably covered by the `nrs_associate`
   tests, but I think it's good to have this test to call it out as functionality we don't want to
   break.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0bc50ae33ccb934016ac425e7bb2eca90a4b06e3/> resolve nrs map container content
   The resolver can now return `NrsMapContainer` content, which can then be displayed by the CLI with
   the `cat` and `dog` commands. This functionality was unintentionally broken at some point.
   
   The first change introduced an `NrsEntry` field in `SafeData`, and modified the `NrsMapContainer` to
   remove its `resolve_into` and `public_name` fields. The intention is for the resolver to return
   `NrsMapContainer` data when a container XOR-URL is used, but when using an NRS URL, an `NrsEntry`
   will be returned. The `NrsMapContainer` data will have the NRS map, whereas the `NrsEntry` will only
   contain the target link and subname version. It's worth noting, the `NrsEntry` doesn't have an
   XOR-URL because the entries are still stored in the map. An NRS URL still has an `NrsMapContainer`
   content type and that content is retrieved during the resolution process.
   
   This brings us to the next change. The `nrs_get` API was modified to return an `Option<SafeUrl>`,
   where `None` will now be returned if the container XOR-URL is used. In this case, the resolver will
   know to return `NrsMapContainer` data, otherwise, it will return the `NrsEntry` with the target URL.
   One exception is worth mentioning: if the NRS URL uses the registered topname and that topname
   *doesn't* link to anything, `NrsMapContainer` data will also be returned. To make these extensions,
   small unit tests were added to the `NrsMap` and several tests were added to the resolver to cover
   these scenarios.
   
   With these changes in place, the CLI could then be updated. The `cat` and `dog` commands were
   modified to print the NRS map when `NrsMapContainer` data was returned. Previously, the map was
   printed as a table, but this isn't really suitable for presentation because the table crate doesn't
   have the ability to use multi-line cells and the target links are too large, so I changed it to
   print a list. Test cases were added for both commands, which should hopefully prevent us breaking
   the feature again.
   
   Finally, some usability changes were also made to `nrs` commands to give the user the XOR-URL of the
   container. This can be useful to them if they want to list all the entries in a map.
 - <csr-id-ced0f6631ac5e8d24546841ba15b8cb7b43929c4/> retrieve subname version
   The `nrs_get` function is changed to make use of the version argument to retrieve a subname at a
   specific version.
   
   A helper struct was created to reduce test verbosity. It uploads a file container and stores file
   path/URL pairs in a hash table.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9af70e7785c9329d8262de99bda68c4ad79d5154/> remove get_target_url function
   This function contained an unnecessary check to see if the `safe://` prefix wasn't present in top
   name or public names, which we wouldn't expect it to be. I'm not sure what I was thinking with this.
   
   Also made some more readability changes based on PR feedback.
 - <csr-id-58bf678793cbf474751c7bccc80e08fe3cd2d192/> subname -> public name
   Since we're now storing the full public name in the NRS map, the key should be referred to as the
   public name rather than the subname. Error messages were also updated.
 - <csr-id-a58f6c5019e73ffbfa0f29965aa0fa62b026ece7/> remove url sanitisation from api
   The `Safe::parse_url` function was removed from the API. This function 'sanitised' a URL by applying
   a `safe://` prefix to a URL string if the caller hadn't specified it.
   
   Initially, it was done to tidy up NRS code that was calling this function, but the same code was
   also calling a private function `parse_url` was making use of, so effectively the code was being
   called twice. More generally, we decided callers of the API should be responsible for passing a
   valid URL.
   
   The function was being called by various other parts of the API and also in the CLI, so these were
   changed to call `SafeUrl::from_url` directly.
   
   Some code was added to CLI commands to apply the `safe://` prefix if the user omitted it, so no
   functionality  was broken. A few test cases were added to cover it. A couple of NRS test cases for
   validating URLs were also removed as they no longer apply. This behaviour may actually have been
   incorrect in the first place.
   
   Also apply various clippy fixes.

### Other

 - <csr-id-effc6fa5a035f8d88b7537eca304e4b0d6de29a3/> rework nrs tests and provide more coverage
   Added more coverage for code paths that weren't being tested:
   * `nrs_create` duplicate topname
   * `nrs_associate` with non-versioned files container link
   * `nrs_associate` with non-versioned NRS map container link
   * `nrs_associate` with register link
   * `nrs_associate` with invalid URL
   
   Some NRS tests were reworked as follows:
   * Make them single purpose. Some tests were testing a few things, which makes it a bit harder to
     identify what's failed.
   * Trim down. Some tests had assertions and setup that didn't seem quite relevant, like checking and
     assigning versions.
   * Test `nrs_associate` without calling `nrs_add`. This muddies the water a little bit because
     `nrs_add` calls associate.
   * Separate `nrs_associate` tests for topnames and subnames.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-1115093a4cb4a0c7ed9f8d2b846aa435a7026b2e/> store full public name in nrs map
   Entries will now use the full public name reference, rather than the just subname. Like so:
   * example -> link
* a.example -> link
* b.example -> link
* a.b.example -> link
 - <csr-id-b2b0520630774d935aca1f2b602a1de9479ba6f9/> enable cmd retries
   Previously a command error would simply error out and fail.
   Now we use an exponential backoff to retry incase errors
   can be overcome

## v0.54.0 (2022-02-01)

<csr-id-889e0d99a6f096329e875c812a29ec165e61f5ae/>
<csr-id-2ec86e28246031084d603768ffa1fddf320a10a2/>

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-889e0d99a6f096329e875c812a29ec165e61f5ae/> nrs map fetch and rename multimap
   The `MultimapKeyValues` type alias was renamed to `Multimap` to make it easier to work with. Some
   functions were also renamed to the same effect, e.g., `fetch_multimap_values` -> `fetch_multimap`.
   
   The function for retrieving the NRS map was also refactored. Some aspects were broken down into
   smaller functions to reduce some complex if/else cases. Things were also setup for the version in
   the last entry in the Multimap to be collected. This is going to be used with the returned
   NrsMapContainer, to facilitate returning links to immutable content, which doesn't have a version.
   Currently the code isn't setup to support that scenario.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-2ec86e28246031084d603768ffa1fddf320a10a2/> safe_network-0.55.1/sn_api-0.54.0/sn_cli-0.47.0

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b2b0520630774d935aca1f2b602a1de9479ba6f9/> enable cmd retries
   Previously a command error would simply error out and fail.
   Now we use an exponential backoff to retry incase errors
   can be overcome
 - <csr-id-3d73dd03a7a6913a248e5cca7d714f8b8e4c0d01/> retrieve immutable content via nrs
   Changes the resolver to enable retrieval of NRS links to immutable content. Previously, the
   NRS `target_url` was incorrectly being checked to see if it contained a version. We now validate
   this URL using the same process used by NRS, which won't assert that a file link has a version. To
   reduce duplication, the `validate_nrs_url` function in the NRS module was changed to public.
   
   Tests were added to both the API and CLI to cover the scenario.
   
   The NrsMap struct was extended to include a subname_version field. This is going to be used to
   request the map with a particular version of a subname. If no version was specified when the
   container was retrieved, then the field won't be set. This is why it's an Option. Since we're
   storing this field on the NrsMap, the `version` field on the `NrsMapContainer` was removed.
   
   A couple of CLI NRS tests were also re-enabled, one of which happened to be related to immutable
   content.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e0885987742226f72ed761e7b78b86e2fa72e256/> dry-runner was making a connection to the network

## v0.53.0 (2022-01-28)

<csr-id-9af70e7785c9329d8262de99bda68c4ad79d5154/>

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9af70e7785c9329d8262de99bda68c4ad79d5154/> remove get_target_url function
   This function contained an unnecessary check to see if the `safe://` prefix wasn't present in top
   name or public names, which we wouldn't expect it to be. I'm not sure what I was thinking with this.
   
   Also made some more readability changes based on PR feedback.
 - <csr-id-58bf678793cbf474751c7bccc80e08fe3cd2d192/> subname -> public name
   Since we're now storing the full public name in the NRS map, the key should be referred to as the
   public name rather than the subname. Error messages were also updated.
 - <csr-id-a58f6c5019e73ffbfa0f29965aa0fa62b026ece7/> remove url sanitisation from api
   The `Safe::parse_url` function was removed from the API. This function 'sanitised' a URL by applying
   a `safe://` prefix to a URL string if the caller hadn't specified it.
   
   Initially, it was done to tidy up NRS code that was calling this function, but the same code was
   also calling a private function `parse_url` was making use of, so effectively the code was being
   called twice. More generally, we decided callers of the API should be responsible for passing a
   valid URL.
   
   The function was being called by various other parts of the API and also in the CLI, so these were
   changed to call `SafeUrl::from_url` directly.
   
   Some code was added to CLI commands to apply the `safe://` prefix if the user omitted it, so no
   functionality  was broken. A few test cases were added to cover it. A couple of NRS test cases for
   validating URLs were also removed as they no longer apply. This behaviour may actually have been
   incorrect in the first place.
   
   Also apply various clippy fixes.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-889e0d99a6f096329e875c812a29ec165e61f5ae/> nrs map fetch and rename multimap
   The `MultimapKeyValues` type alias was renamed to `Multimap` to make it easier to work with. Some
   functions were also renamed to the same effect, e.g., `fetch_multimap_values` -> `fetch_multimap`.
   
   The function for retrieving the NRS map was also refactored. Some aspects were broken down into
   smaller functions to reduce some complex if/else cases. Things were also setup for the version in
   the last entry in the Multimap to be collected. This is going to be used with the returned
   NrsMapContainer, to facilitate returning links to immutable content, which doesn't have a version.
   Currently the code isn't setup to support that scenario.

### Other

 - <csr-id-effc6fa5a035f8d88b7537eca304e4b0d6de29a3/> rework nrs tests and provide more coverage
   Added more coverage for code paths that weren't being tested:
   * `nrs_create` duplicate topname
   * `nrs_associate` with non-versioned files container link
   * `nrs_associate` with non-versioned NRS map container link
   * `nrs_associate` with register link
   * `nrs_associate` with invalid URL
   
   Some NRS tests were reworked as follows:
   * Make them single purpose. Some tests were testing a few things, which makes it a bit harder to
     identify what's failed.
   * Trim down. Some tests had assertions and setup that didn't seem quite relevant, like checking and
     assigning versions.
   * Test `nrs_associate` without calling `nrs_add`. This muddies the water a little bit because
     `nrs_add` calls associate.
   * Separate `nrs_associate` tests for topnames and subnames.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-366eee25f4b982d5a20d90168368a1aa14aa3181/> safe_network-0.55.0/sn_api-0.53.0/sn_cli-0.46.0

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3d73dd03a7a6913a248e5cca7d714f8b8e4c0d01/> retrieve immutable content via nrs
   Changes the resolver to enable retrieval of NRS links to immutable content. Previously, the
   NRS `target_url` was incorrectly being checked to see if it contained a version. We now validate
   this URL using the same process used by NRS, which won't assert that a file link has a version. To
   reduce duplication, the `validate_nrs_url` function in the NRS module was changed to public.
   
   Tests were added to both the API and CLI to cover the scenario.
   
   The NrsMap struct was extended to include a subname_version field. This is going to be used to
   request the map with a particular version of a subname. If no version was specified when the
   container was retrieved, then the field won't be set. This is why it's an Option. Since we're

   content.
 - <csr-id-1115093a4cb4a0c7ed9f8d2b846aa435a7026b2e/> store full public name in nrs map
   Entries will now use the full public name reference, rather than the just subname. Like so:
   * example -> link
* a.example -> link
* b.example -> link
* a.b.example -> link

### Test

 - <csr-id-2b7c72c3f87f34051ea301250d1af258f9d310cb/> adapting test_files_container_remove_path test to new behavior

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-bb7abce7330a432884e80baa2aa158409e9734d0/> refactoring files API tests
   - Also removing Url resolver recursive implementation (in favor of an iteration) since it's memory-wise
     inneficient creating new Vec for each resolution step and not providing any benefits.
   - Removing the restriction in files API which was preventing input Urls to contain a version/hash.

   This reverts commit 63432eb2e528401ae67da8eea0c82837ab42fc18.
   
   This release was duplicating everything that was in 0.41.0, probably because the tags weren't
   correct.

   nodes havent had time to update their own data yet).
   
   Timeout is configurable per safe app api instance, sop could be exposed

   We use time formatting, so this feature should be necessary for the
   crate to compile. Weirdly, compilation only fails when publishing, not
   when checking or building. It's assumed this has something to do with
   feature resolution in workspaces 🤷

### Style

 - <csr-id-a4b7d9ba415831308c5ec6d902722843715a2d97/> fix styling by cargo fmt

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-86910340897256bb4df77b6edaa0f2c9584d6dce/> update cli to use new nrs api
   There are changes here to update the NRS command handlers to use the new API for NRS, and other
   smaller changes for referencing types that had been moved to new modules. This commit also restores
   a function, `get_map_summary`, that was deleted from the `NrsMap` struct. The CLI `cat` and `dog`
   commands still relied on this functionality, so it's been provided as a placeholder for now, just to
   get the CLI to compile.
   
   At this point, the NRS test suite is not passing, because there have been some behavioural changes
   as part of the refactor. Unfortunately, because of the state of the rest of the network just now,
   it's hard to isolate these specific changes to get the tests passing again, as other functionality
   like the `cat` command appear to be broken just now too.
   
   I think it's worth committing this as it is now, with the CLI compiling, then we can come back and
   address the other issues that will get the test suite passing again.

### Other

 - <csr-id-3da9b26f467cb8c468ffb0a319559a5a0f60e86e/> fix api tests.
   Removes retry_loop as it's no longer needed for general queries, clients retry in the core lib.
   
   Set the query timeout correctly and so reduces test time.
   Removes api_tests TEST_AUTH setting to a cli dependency auth variable which may not exist and isn't needed. Falls back to random keys.
 - <csr-id-3703819c7f0da220c8ff21169ca1e8161a20157b/> update actions workflows for workspace refactor
   Now that we have multiple crates in the same repository, if we only want to do things when subsets
   of the source tree have been modified (e.g. only one crate particular crate has changed), it does
   make the CI situation a bit more cumbersome. We need to make much more frequent use the path filter
   action and only do things if certain files have been changed.
   
   It's also useful for the workflows to indicate the crate they relate to, so they've been renamed or
   added to accommodate that.
   
   Certain things have been moved to the level of the workspace because with these, you can't really
   discriminate based on the crate that's changed.
   
   An unused dependency for sn_api was also taken out here.
 - <csr-id-d0134e870bb097e095e1c8a33e607cf7994e6491/> update actions workflows for workspace refactor

 - <csr-id-407efd15e0b4854864b83ccdb7d2c3adbb0a02e2/> appease clippy
 - <csr-id-442c1bdd3f9c22424aa9642d71d4016c868b0b58/> switch from `chrono` to `time`
   Due to the active security advisory against chrono (RUSTSEC-2020-0159)
   is makes sense to switch to a library that is not affected (though we
   are not using the affected APIs in `chrono`).
 - <csr-id-0387123114ff6ae42920577706497319c8a888cb/> upgrade `tracing-appender` and `tracing-subscriber`
   These new versions have dropped their dependence on `chrono`, which has
   an active security advisory against it (RUSTSEC-2020-0159) which seems
   unlikely to be resolved.
   
   `chrono` is still being pulled in by `qp2p` (via `rcgen`), `sn_api`, and
   `sn_launch_tool`. This will be fixed in future commits.
 - <csr-id-225432908839359800d301d9e5aa8274e4652ee1/> move safe_network code into sn directory
   Due to the fact that we're now using multiple crates, the safe_network code is moved into the `sn`
   directory.
   
   A Cargo.toml is added to the root directory to establish this repository as a workspace, currently
   with 2 members, sn and sn_api. If you now run a `cargo build` at the root directory, it will build
   both of these crates.
   
   The Github Actions workflows that were brought in from the `sn_api` merge were also removed here.
 - <csr-id-2b5d17740ca74fc379cab89cb95683e200589148/> move sn_api code into an sn_api directory
   The initial merge of the `sn_api` repository put the code for `sn_api` into the `src` directory at
   the root of the repository, which has merged it in alongside the code for `safe_network`. We now
   create an `sn_api` directory at the root of the repository and move the `sn_api` code in here. This
   completely isolates the code for `sn_api` in its own crate, with the same Cargo.toml from the old
   repository.
   
   As things are, the crate builds fine.
 - <csr-id-01183625d7a1a60b652b1a295a908fa8ba04f6f7/> upgrade sn_api to use 0.36.x of safe_network
   The only code breaking change here was that the `Config::new` function had been extended to use a
   new `query_timeout` parameter. For now, the API is opting not to pass a value for this optional
