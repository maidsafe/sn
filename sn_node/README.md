# sn_node

The Safe Network Node Implementation.

## Building

### OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)

OTLP allows for inspecting and visualizing log spans.

By specifying the `otlp` feature for the `sn_node` binary, logs will be sent to an OTLP endpoint. This endpoint can be configured by environment variables. (See [opentelemetry.io/docs/...](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/exporter/) for more information.)

```sh
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" # Already the default
export RUST_LOG=sn_node=info # This filters the output for stdout/files, not OTLP
export RUST_LOG_OTLP=sn_node=trace # This filters what is sent to OTLP endpoint 
cargo run --release --bin sn_node --features otlp -- --first --local-addr=127.0.0.1:0
```

Before running the node, an OTLP endpoint should be available. An example of an OTLP-supporting endpoint is Jaeger, which can be launched with Docker like this (see [documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.42/getting-started/#all-in-one)):
```
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.41
```

In the web interface of Jaeger (http://localhost:16686) one can filter several things, e.g. the tag `service.instance.id=<PID>`, where PID is the process ID of the node. The service name is `sn_node`.
