### New Features

<csr-id-0cd47ad56e0d93e3e99feb0dfcea8094f871ff6f/>

 - <csr-id-464710fe8a964dc274e40327b85c0b17d9b92b0f/> provide `--config-dir-path` arg for `safe`
   Add a global `--config-dir-path` argument that will set the location of the config directory. If
   it's not set, the `SAFE_CONFIG_DIR_PATH` environment variable will be used, and if that's not set,
   we will default to `$HOME/.safe`.
   
   The purpose of this customisation is for integration testing so that each test can use an isolated
   configuration directory, but users can apply it too if they wish.
 - <csr-id-5c8b1f50d1bf346d45bd2a9faf92bbf33cb448da/> client retry spend on unknown section key
   When the client receives an unknown section key error, it will obtain the proof chain and SAP for
   the unknown section and resubmit the request with this additional information.
   
   There is no automated client test for this scenario. We went to great lengths to try, but it proved
   not worth the effort. It was too difficult to modify the network knowledge with a fake section and
   still have things function correctly. The scenario is unit tested on the node side, and we done
   enough testing to know that the retry loop does what's intended.
   
   There are a few misc changes along with this commit:
   
   * Debugging message to indicate a spend request being processed correctly, which proved useful when
   trying to get the automated test working.
* Remove the current section key from the unknown section key error. It's not necessary to include
     this.
* When running the baby fleming network with the Makefile, include log messages from `sn_interface`.
* Fix up git-based references to `sn_dbc` crate.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8855c50b2e47be4298220c9e1f79a57403fd4ac0/> add upload limit to cli cfg
 - <csr-id-fa82955cd4e8ad82372089fd08e11e19dcaee42b/> add upload limit to cli cfg
 - <csr-id-526bdca588bd458d8e60d8e4066e98f692bc8e59/> disable node install tests

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-1152b2764e955edd80fb33921a8d8fe52654a896/> get public commitments from sn_dbc
   The code for retrieving and validating the public commitments was moved out to the sn_dbc crate.
   
   It's needed for both the spend request and test setup code which is going to be referenced in both
   `sn_node` and `sn_client`.
   
   Also fixed a clippy error in `SectionTree::get_signed_by_key`.

### Style

 - <csr-id-73f5531790ef8817ed3551fd9e4bcbcc7fc6f4f9/> applied clippy nightly
   Mainly lints `iter_kv_map` (e.g. use `keys()`, instead of `iter()`, which
   iterates over both keys and values where the value is not used) and `needless_borrow`.

### Test

 - <csr-id-096b9c67671324109aa2939e3806813501248cc6/> use isolated config dir for cli tests
   A function is added to the test utils library for creating a temporary directory that functions as
   the config directory for the CLI. It uses `assert_fs`, so the directory will be automatically
   deleted when the reference to it is dropped. This enables each test case to use its own config
   directory, which resolves issues we've had with multiple instances of `safe` writing/reading the
   config file in a race situation.
   
   The functions for running `safe` commands were changed to require the config directory to be
   passed. This forces each test case to use this mechanism.
   
   All the tests were updated to use the same naming convention, with the exception of the `files get`
   tests, which are quite tedious and probably best left with the convention they were using, at least
   for now.
   
   Some tests could be un-ignored as part of this change.
   
   The API and CLI test suites had their single-thread limitation removed.
 - <csr-id-ff59202d1374c7e5dcc570d50ed8b399fafe488d/> feature-gated send_query API to verify data is stored in all replicas for each query
   - Introducing a new `check-replicas` feature to sn_client (as well as sn_api and CLI), which switches
   the `Client::send_query` API behavior to send the query to all Adults replicas and it expects a
   valid response from all of them instead of from just one.
   - Running sn_client, sn_api, and CLI tests in CI with new `check-replicas` feature enabled to verify
   data was stored in all Adults replicas.
   - With `check-replicas` feature enabled, query responses from all Adults replicas are also compared
   to verify they are all the same.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3c383ccf9ad0ed77080fb3e3ec459e5b02158505/> passing the churn test
   This commit contains the work to passing the churn test.
   There are mainly two fixes:
   1, Only trigger data reorganization when there is membership update.
   Previously, data reorganzation get undertaken whenever there is
   incoming message. Which result in a looping of messaging among
   nodes.
   2, Only broadcast result when the QueryResponse is not an error.
   Previously, this will cause the client thinking the whole query
   is failed whenever an error response received.

 - <csr-id-4e04a2b0acc79140bf1d0aefd82c0ad5b046a3cd/> remove unused asyncs (clippy)
   Upon removing async keywords from
   sn_interface/src/network_knowledge/mod.rs a lot of removal propagated up
   and removed most of it with help of Clippy. Clippy does not yet detect
   unnecessary async in methods
   (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/9024), but will soon.
   
   With the help of a new Clippy lint:
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -W clippy::unused_async
   And automatically fixing code with:
   cargo fix --broken-code --allow-dirty --all-targets --all-features
   
   Results mostly from the single thread work of @joshuef in #1253 (and
   ongoing efforts).

 - <csr-id-3f3c39a14987910bb424df51f89d948333ca3e87/> changes based on review feedback
   * Prefer `map_err` in various places rather than a full `match`.
   * Change key serialization utility functions to static rather than instance.
   * Change `dog` command to print non-support of `SafeKey` data type rather than panic.
   * Remove unnecessary clone on `public_key_hex`.
   * Remove unnecessary match in various tests.
   * Ignore wallet CLI tests that deleted the credentials file. They are problematic when running in
     parallel with other tests. We need better isolated testing mechanisms for these. Will address in a
     separate PR.
   * Use different deposit names in wallet tests where multiple DBCs are deposited.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-341306acd1e16290fe9a8ec676499feec8ef7639/> extend cli wallet deposit for owned dbcs
   The CLI is now extended to support the deposit of owned DBCs.
   
   The `deposit` command will check if the supplied DBC is owned, and if it is, it will check to see if
   the `--secret-key` argument is present and use that. If that argument isn't present, it will attempt
   to use the secret key that's configured for use with the CLI, i.e., the `keys create --for-cli`
   command.
   
   The `reissue` command was also extended to provide an `--owned` flag, which when used, will reissue
   an owned DBC using the public key configured for use with the CLI. This argument is mutually
   exclusive with the `--public-key` argument, which will reissue the DBC using a specified key.
   
   So we could offer the user a suggestion when a supplied secret key didn't match, this also involved
   making a little extension to the API, to return a specific type of error. We will need to modify
   `sn_dbc` to return a specific error type for this too, so we can avoid checking the string content
   of the error message, but this will be covered on a separate PR.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-93baf94d0c347b02bf803d4b3a867fd07cdebaf5/> remove use of xorurl with keys command
   The use of BLS keys means the XorUrl that was displayed to the user will no longer be usable, since
   the BLS key is a 48-byte structure, and not 32 bytes like the Dalek key. We will come back and
   address this issue later, possibly re-introducing the `SafeKey` type in some kind of different form.
   
   The functionality and corresponding test cases for the `cat` and `dog` command that were working
   with the `SafeKey` data type were removed.
   
   The test cases for the `keys` commands were elaborated here to check the output of both the pretty
   print and the json formats and to make sure the CLI prints out a matching keypair.
 - <csr-id-5577695b5d3291c46cd475df8c0933a067b4cfc5/> serialize to bls keys in util functions
   Utility functions were recently added to the API for serializing to the `Keypair` type. This was
   changed to serialize directly to BLS to make it easier for the CLI to deal directly with BLS keys.
   Soon we will be refactoring the `Keypair` type to have a different use case and things like
   `sn_client` would be refactored to directly work with BLS keys. This is a little step in that
   direction.
   
   There was a utility function added to `sn_interface` to create a `Keypair` from a hex-based BLS key
   because we still need to use the `Keypair` at this point in time.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-80e27349fb4ebeb19be3aa3e5ae9f2d8d8095313/> dbc arg can refer to file or dbc data
   The `--dbc` argument for the `wallet deposit` command is extended so it can refer to either a file
   path or DBC data. It will be tested first for an existing file path, otherwise it will fall back to
   being interpreted as DBC data.
   
   Some people have been having trouble with pasting DBC data directly via the command line, depending
   on what OS or shell is in use. You can still also pass the data via stdin, but that's only available
   on Linux or macOS.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-c12e2269e3a537d96422bed96a4459a0add07deb/> upgrade sn_dbc to 3.2.0
   This new release has utilities for serializing/deserializing `Dbc` to/from hex.
 - <csr-id-e548388c693cfb71b270cf9e370b2f9b463044c5/> upgrade sn_dbc to 3.2.0
   This new release has utilities for serializing/deserializing `Dbc` to/from hex.
 - <csr-id-e2f854435451e30ac93098501b9e224fe51c5e5a/> some review feedback
   Removed references to ed25519 in the `keys` command documentation and also removed a redundant test
   run in the Makefile target that emulates the CI tests.
 - <csr-id-210c54e8814877c15d87150248fe3858e83eeee8/> remove use of test-utils from test runs
   After doing a rebase from main, the test-utils feature was removed. I updated the testing targets
   and also replaced bad references to logger initialisation functions.

 - <csr-id-4c6e6cff474d306e6632f004c6cf05729c7ced16/> add public key argument for owned dbcs
   The `wallet reissue` command now has an additional optional argument, `--public-key`, which allows
   the user to reissue a DBC to be owned by the holder of that public key. The key should be BLS
   hex-encoded.
   
   The `wallet deposit` command will now require extension to provide the secret key when depositing an
   owned DBC. This will be done as a separate piece of work.
   
   Some additional changes were made in support or to tidy CLI-related code:
   * The conversion of DBCs to/from hex were removed from the CLI since this is now done on the `Dbc`
   type.
* A CLI test that existed to test the above conversion code was removed since it's no longer
     necessary.
* The naming scheme for the CLI wallet tests were elaborated and the redundant "calling_safe"
     prefixes were removed.
* The conversion of DBCs to/from hex were removed from the CLI since this is now done on the `Dbc`
     type.
* A CLI test that existed to test the above conversion code was removed since it's no longer

 - <csr-id-e662317e93b3247a1afd9970587ea7241a9b5619/> first and basic implementation of Wallet reissue API and related CLI cmds
   - Generate output DBCs with sn_dbc::TransactionBuilder

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-cf482c38278dd0aaebbf2711462b0f58b7635049/> node install command to use correct version
   When we added the new `sn_interface` crate, we forgot to update these functions for selecting the
   version number of sn_node. This would have been caught by our test for this command, but
   unfortunately that test can't run because it's subject to random failures due to rate limiting from
   the Github API.
   
   The README for the release process is also updated to include this as a step.

### Other

 - <csr-id-a477c1db40b9d8f78adf3f620942a06daf0ecc2b/> incorporate sn_client and sn_node in release process
   The `sn_client` and `sn_node` crates had to be included for publishing in the release process.
   
   There were a few other changes I made to support this:
   
   * The title of the release, with all the crate names, was getting too large. I changed it to just
     include the version numbers. The description of the release now includes the list of crates and
     the version numbers they relate to.
   * Stop passing the version numbers around for the changelog generation. We can just read them from
     the Cargo manifest.
   * Change crate publishing to a sequential process, rather than have different jobs.

   With the addition on the dysfunction crate, this introduced a new version number into the tag name.
   The parsing had to be updated for this.
   
   I've also re-enabled the test that would have caught this. It shouldn't be as much of a problem with
   nextest, which has the ability to retry tests. I've seen the rate limited stuff passing ok on
   retries. If we see it fail, we can disable it again.

   tilde w/ a major version restricts us to path udpats only.
   we want caret, which is implicit frm v 1

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-eaeca4223c4e35884bfd1129832b890e70b6ef5e/> upgrade to new version of qjsonrpc
   The `sn_api` crate is updated to use the new version of `qjsonrpc`.
   
   The `qjsonrpc` library had breaking changes to pass cert and key paths rather than passing a
   directory that was assumed to contain them. This change caused `sn_api` to do the same. There is an
   unfortunate consequence here: to use `SafeAuthdClient` you need to pass a certificate, along with
   another certificate and a private key for starting an endpoint that deals with notifications for
   approving authentication requests. The previous setup was just making the assumption that both keys
   and certificates were in the same directory. Since this change led to an odd interface for
   `SafeAuthdClient` we had some discussion around using a different mechanism for notifications, but
   we decided to come back to it later with a wider review.
   
   The API change forced an update to some code in the CLI, even though the authd system isn't really
   being used at the moment. The self-signed certificates are now being generated in the CLI. Since the
   CLI is a specific application, I think this is a more appropriate place for that to happen.

 - <csr-id-59caff8609e3263dfa9c63d29eb967b602bf85d8/> further updates for cli user guide
   Several changes were made to bring the user guide up-to-date:
   * Move the XorUrl section to near the top of the document, below the network setup section. I done
   this because I think it makes sense to explain the URL concept early, since it's used by every
   command.
* Add a new section on Keys, where it's relevant to current network functionality. The previous Keys
     documentation was removed because it referred to out-of-date features.
* Re-write the NRS, Cat and Dog documentation to make it a bit leaner.
* Remove the section on shell completions. I'm going to come back to this very shortly and possibly
     include the completions to install them along with the application.
* Remove links to the 'Safe Dev Hub' from the Further Help section.

 - <csr-id-499db88b4e3fb57671a069f36aa3a71c945fb2fd/> powershell install script for cli
   Provide a Powershell install script for Windows users. This removes the requirement for using Git
   Bash or other Linux emulation to setup the CLI.
   
   The install process is:
   * Download and install the Visual C++ Redistributable
   * Create the `%USERPROFILE%\.safe\cli` directory
   * Add `%USERPROFILE%\.safe\cli` to the user `PATH` variable
   * Download and unpack the latest version of `safe` to `%USERPROFILE%\.safe\cli`
   
   A few points worth noting. First, the script can run without admin access, but the VC++ install
   requires that, so it will elevate to admin to run that. Second, the script is idempotent, so it will
   run OK, if, e.g., VC++ is already installed. Third, the addition of the `PATH` variable
   unfortunately requires users to start a new Powershell session. Finally, if VC++ was installed, that
   requires a machine restart. The script informs users of either of those, and they are only required
   the first time.
   
   I tested it on a minimal Windows installation on a VM, before the VC++ prerequisite had been
   installed. It worked as intended in this setup. A test was added to the nightly run.
   
   The README was updated to provide the user with instructions for running the script.

 - <csr-id-6e40898eb9ff007f60ddc5ea946318773fb90e55/> sudo based installation for cli
   Give users the option to run the CLI installer as sudo.
   
   In this case, the CLI will be installed to /usr/local/bin, which is very common for installations on
   Linux. That location is almost always already on PATH, even in minimal setups. This removes the need
   for modifying any of the user's shell configurations, which some users don't like. I've also
   personally dealt with users who had a problem when the installer wasn't modifying their shell
   configuration correctly.
   
   Some simple installer tests were added to the nightly configuration and the README was also updated
   with new instructions, which included fixing an invalid link to the install script.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0bc50ae33ccb934016ac425e7bb2eca90a4b06e3/> resolve nrs map container content
   The resolver can now return `NrsMapContainer` content, which can then be displayed by the CLI with
   the `cat` and `dog` commands. This functionality was unintentionally broken at some point.
   
   The first change introduced an `NrsEntry` field in `SafeData`, and modified the `NrsMapContainer` to
   remove its `resolve_into` and `public_name` fields. The intention is for the resolver to return
   `NrsMapContainer` data when a container XOR-URL is used, but when using an NRS URL, an `NrsEntry`
   will be returned. The `NrsMapContainer` data will have the NRS map, whereas the `NrsEntry` will only
   contain the target link and subname version. It's worth noting, the `NrsEntry` doesn't have an
   XOR-URL because the entries are still stored in the map. An NRS URL still has an `NrsMapContainer`
   content type and that content is retrieved during the resolution process.
   
   This brings us to the next change. The `nrs_get` API was modified to return an `Option<SafeUrl>`,
   where `None` will now be returned if the container XOR-URL is used. In this case, the resolver will
   know to return `NrsMapContainer` data, otherwise, it will return the `NrsEntry` with the target URL.
   One exception is worth mentioning: if the NRS URL uses the registered topname and that topname
   *doesn't* link to anything, `NrsMapContainer` data will also be returned. To make these extensions,
   small unit tests were added to the `NrsMap` and several tests were added to the resolver to cover
   these scenarios.
   
   With these changes in place, the CLI could then be updated. The `cat` and `dog` commands were
   modified to print the NRS map when `NrsMapContainer` data was returned. Previously, the map was
   printed as a table, but this isn't really suitable for presentation because the table crate doesn't
   have the ability to use multi-line cells and the target links are too large, so I changed it to
   print a list. Test cases were added for both commands, which should hopefully prevent us breaking
   the feature again.
   
   Finally, some usability changes were also made to `nrs` commands to give the user the XOR-URL of the
   container. This can be useful to them if they want to list all the entries in a map.

   This function contained an unnecessary check to see if the `safe://` prefix wasn't present in top
   name or public names, which we wouldn't expect it to be. I'm not sure what I was thinking with this.
   
   Also made some more readability changes based on PR feedback.
 - <csr-id-a58f6c5019e73ffbfa0f29965aa0fa62b026ece7/> remove url sanitisation from api
   The `Safe::parse_url` function was removed from the API. This function 'sanitised' a URL by applying
   a `safe://` prefix to a URL string if the caller hadn't specified it.
   
   Initially, it was done to tidy up NRS code that was calling this function, but the same code was
   also calling a private function `parse_url` was making use of, so effectively the code was being
   called twice. More generally, we decided callers of the API should be responsible for passing a
   valid URL.
   
   The function was being called by various other parts of the API and also in the CLI, so these were
   changed to call `SafeUrl::from_url` directly.
   
   Some code was added to CLI commands to apply the `safe://` prefix if the user omitted it, so no
   functionality  was broken. A few test cases were added to cover it. A couple of NRS test cases for
   validating URLs were also removed as they no longer apply. This behaviour may actually have been
   incorrect in the first place.
   
   Also apply various clippy fixes.

   Changes the resolver to enable retrieval of NRS links to immutable content. Previously, the
   NRS `target_url` was incorrectly being checked to see if it contained a version. We now validate
   this URL using the same process used by NRS, which won't assert that a file link has a version. To

   Tests were added to both the API and CLI to cover the scenario.
   
   The NrsMap struct was extended to include a subname_version field. This is going to be used to
   request the map with a particular version of a subname. If no version was specified when the
   container was retrieved, then the field won't be set. This is why it's an Option. Since we're
   storing this field on the NrsMap, the `version` field on the `NrsMapContainer` was removed.
   
   A couple of CLI NRS tests were also re-enabled, one of which happened to be related to immutable

### Other

 - <csr-id-ad2e30cf52cd8be01c00353d722ea1107c43a641/> nightly release run
   Sets up a release build to run nightly. It runs as follows:
   * Build the node binary using the latest code
   * Launch the testnet on Digital Ocean using our custom action
   * Run the client tests against the testnet
   * Run the API tests against the testnet
   * Run the CLI tests against the testnet
   * Kill the testnet
   * Bump any version numbers and push a new release commit to `main`
   
   The push to `main` should then trigger the release workflow, which will run as usual.
   
   A few noteworthy points:
   * In theory, the testnet custom action can build the node on a large Digital Ocean VM, but I found
     it unreliable.
   * The 3 test suites _could_ run in parallel, but for now they run sequentially.
   * All test suites get the opportunity to run, even if the previous one fails.
   * If any suite fails, the testnet is killed and no version bumping occurs.
   
   There were also a couple of changes related to CLI tests:
   * Change the `files tree` test to not use hard coded sizes for files. One of the test data files had
     been changed, and it also appeared to be the case that you could get a different file size if you
     uploaded files from Windows.
   * Set the ignore attribute on the `node install` latest version test. This test uses the Github API
     to get the latest version, and there appeared to be rate limiting issues, despite the fact that we
     would only make 3 calls for the entire test suite.

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-0f44890b8d5cd7055a790f70cdf6d167532ada05/> reintroduce the `files sync` command
   The `files sync` command is described, but this time a bit more succinctly. The `--update-nrs`
   argument was omitted because it doesn't seem to be working any more.
   
   Also changed:
   * Fixed the indentation levels for the table of contents.
* Provide a small section to describe an example directory used by all commands.
* Update other sections to use the above examples directory.
* Clarify description of container base paths.
* Move the `files ls` section immediately after `files put`, as I think it makes sense to introduce
     the concept of listing files after you've uploaded them.
* Trim down the `files get` section.
* Trim down the `files tree` section.

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-4e0d82ec847edd0da621208e906deffb5aa89ac2/> align cli user guide with current features
   The CLI user guide hadn't been updated for some time, so I brought it more in line with current features. Where relevant so far, I also trimmed the text to make it more concise.
   
   The following updates were made:
   
   * Reduce the indentation levels of the whole document.
* Add a Quickstart section to get users going with a single command if they want to avoid reading lots of setup text. Windows was explicitly left out because having a Git Bash installation does not constitute the ability to quick start.
* Re-work the previous 'Download' section to an 'Installation and Setup' section.
* Restructure the 'Networks' section with a new example using remote networks.
* Temporarily remove the 'Interactive Shell' section. This was using a feature that didn't exist any more.
* Temporarily remove the 'SafeKeys' section, which used examples referring to removed features. This can be added back in but applied to currently relevant features. I didn't understand it enough to apply it at the moment.
* Trim the wordy prose in the 'Files' section. This helps the reader get to the salient issues quicker.
* Temporarily remove documentation for `files sync`. This command wasn't behaving as described currently, and I'm not sure the NRS stuff still applied. Didn't have time to go into it in detail. This section also has wordy prose that could benefit from being trimmed down. I'll do that when I add it back in.
* Temporarily remove the NRS section. This is completely out of sync with the new NRS commands and terminology and I suspect it can also be made less verbose.
* Remove the 'Auth' section, since this feature has been removed.
* Remove the 'Sequences' section, since this feature has been removed.
* Remove the 'Updates' section, since this feature is currently not enabled.
* Remove the `shell` style from the ``` code blocks since we don't need shell syntax highlighting. There's only one line of shell and the rest is showing the output of the command, which isn't shell code.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-dffcd4e3dd07f99dd3a4f4330637cab9380db9c3/> use s3 as download source for sn_node
   Now that we've restructured the release process such that one release has all crates, it makes it
   more difficult and awkward to install specific versions of any of the binaries, when Github Releases
   are the source of the download. This is because you can't query Github releases to search for the
   version number of one component. If you want to get a particular version of something by a
   convention (like say the tag name on the release), you need to know the version number for each of
   the 3 components.
   
   Here the `node install` command is changed to use the Github API to get the latest version, but once
   the version is obtained, we download the binary from S3. This is so we can also support downloading
   specific versions. Using the S3 bucket, we can do this by convention, based on the version number
   and the target platform. It happens to be the case that the self update crate provides some
   functions for querying the API and also downloading and extracting a binary from a compressed tar
   archive, so we're still making use of that crate here.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-6b59ad852f89f033caf2b3c7dfcfa3019f8129e8/> safe_network-0.52.0/sn_api-0.47.0/sn_cli-0.40.0
 - <csr-id-f6ffbdb5d999f84e3531a6dcd9dcdbacefd50d18/> sn_cli-v0.39.2
   This was a manually generated commit, because smart-release didn't detect any changes in the sn_cli
   crate.
 - <csr-id-d201f7e3480a8a12f488e2a54886cca942904a18/> re-introduce version arg for cli install script
   The release process has been modified to upload all our releases to S3, so we can re-introduce the
   `--version` argument for installing specific versions. If the user supplies a version, we can get
   that from S3. Otherwise, we'll get the latest version from Github Releases.
   
   Also run a `cargo fmt` after a rebase with some conflicts.
 - <csr-id-f59ec2c6da30b13fc2606d2834fad108a56c3621/> remove `self-update` feature from `node install`
   This feature should really never have been applied to `node install`, since self update for the node
   occurs on the node binary itself. We only want to disable self update for the CLI and we still want
   the `node install` feature.
   
   This means that the `self-update` feature itself isn't actually tied to the `self_update` crate,
   which will still be used, because parts of its functionality are used for the `node install`
   command.
   
   It will now just disable the CLI itself from updating, which a separate concern from the `node`
   command.
   
   This also fixes a little mistake with the tag_name for the release not being assigned correctly.
 - <csr-id-b6f0c3f193e8116bcd08126b949eb1a2e9b5aaa5/> replacing calls to unwrap() and expect(...) with proper Result handling
 - <csr-id-8aeca3dffdf92341d34e1f6856160cff57cf0d6a/> re-enable CLI tests in CI

This is a manual changelog entry. Subsequent CLI releases will use the automated changelog generated by `smart-release`.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-8d402e8b2255edf139e3c3507e6597e581719ad4/> build asset download url in cli
   The asset download URL is being incorrectly assigned in the `self_update` crate. As per the previous
   commit, we're trying to resolve this upstream, but don't know how long it will take.
   
   Instead, we use a temporary workaround, which is our own code to determine the download URL. We are
   still `self_update` to download and extract the release archives. When the issue is fixed, we can
   remove this code.
   
   As part of this work, I added some integration tests for the `node install` command and tidied up
   some of its documentation. These tests will run in the CLI test suite. To enable better testing, an
   environment variable was added to specify the location of the CLI's config directory; we don't need
   to expose this as an option to users, though it would be there if we wanted to.

### Other

 - <csr-id-1a8bbb7ebe4737f931cec259dc7863b84531f2c3/> disable self update feature in sn_cli
   Due to moving everything into one repository, the self update feature isn't working at the moment.
   We will need to revisit and fix it. For now, I'm just disabling the feature from the release build
   of the CLI.
   
   Also fix a clippy warning that ideally should have been done on the last commit.
 - <csr-id-45f1f02bbdb61e7c698f1f6a5a62fb63ed01aae3/> update use of nrs in other areas
   I've been able to remove the `ignore` attributes to re-enable tests in other categories that were
   using NRS. The `files sync` issue still hasn't been addressed yet.
   
   The following test updates were made:
   
   * calling_safe_cat_xorurl_with_version: this test was ignored because of the `files sync` issue, but I
     believe it was better to reduce the scope of this test to check that `cat` works with a versioned
     url, rather than testing the versioning system itself.
   * calling_safe_cat_nrsurl_with_version: likewise, the scope of this test was reduced and thus the
     `files sync` issue didn't apply any more.
 - <csr-id-ffea442b710f0051483523297968c9bcbc81419b/> remove previous nrs tests
   To me, these tests were lacking a clear purpose and they didn't map directly onto any of the
   commands. They should now be made obsolete by the new tests, which map to specific commands and
   scenarios.
 - <csr-id-db98472ad8af2a61aa8edf594119ed6b7a92d3ad/> add coverage for `nrs remove` command
   There are no behavioural changes in the command, but there was a little bit of code refactoring and
   some improved user experience by way of error messages and suggestions.
   
   We need to come back and revisit some odd behaviour with this command, related to removing topnames
   and attempting to remove subnames that don't exist.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-ae44ebbf46a72bf1897f8c6004466290f8425db7/> sn_cli-v0.39.0
   This release is being performed 'manually' so that the first sn_cli crate can be published to
   crates.io. From that point forward, `smart-release` should hopefully be able to pick up the changes
   in the CLI.
   
   The changelog entry here is a manual one that's been done from memory, so it may well be missing
   certain things. Moving forward, the changelog will be generated automatically.
 - <csr-id-634a8f9f307598c51305067444514b43c85f196d/> sn_api-0.46.0
 - <csr-id-b09f8307fd1047eb92d2cfe1a6ed38731f6e09e2/> remove use of `indicatif` crate
   This was another crate that was using a git reference. It provides progress bars and other
   mechanisms for updating terminal user interfaces with progress on long running tasks. We were using
   this crate to display some progress bars during the `files get` command.
   
   Obviously, removing the crate means we no longer have the progress bars in the UI, but we already
   had a text-based mechanism for displaying progress, so for the time being, we can fall back on this.
   We can look at other progress bar crates or refactor `files get` to work in parallel.
   
   The main crate used a design that made use of threads for handling the display and update of
   multiple progress bars, but our code for `files get` is synchronous. The forked crate was used
   because it had a mechanism for updating the display in a single-threaded manner.
   
   Removing this crate now means we should be able to get `sn_cli` published, which I would argue is
   currently of higher priority.
 - <csr-id-e52a0c063f747e0be1525f07f8f759f4b9d042a7/> add recursion limit for clippy
 - <csr-id-855f3042859dd641231135de618520050861c348/> use versioned self update crate
   Currently the `self_update` crate has an issue whereby the wrong download URL is assigned to assets
   on the Github release. We've fixed this issue on our own fork of the crate, and we're currently
   speaking to the owner to try and get it merged in, but there could potentially be an indefinite
   amount of time in getting that merged and a new version of that crate released.
   
   In the mean time, we really need to get a release of `sn_cli`, but with our new release process, we
   can't do so without having a it published on crates.io. Therefore, this commit is reverting back to
   the versioned `self_update` crate that has the problem in it, but the next commit will provide some
   temporary code to work around the URL problem.
   
   As part of the work here, I've made a few changes to ensure that the CLI can actually build if the
   `self-update` feature is switched off, and I also removed an optional dependency on the `reqwest`
   crate, which was tied to the `self-update` feature. The reason for this is because there's some code
   in one of the `networks` commands that can download a network config from a remote location, and we
   need to make an HTTP request for that. I realise `reqwest` may be a large dependency, but in my
   view, it doesn't make sense to tie this code to the `self-update` feature, since the `networks`
   commands have no relation to `self_update`.
 - <csr-id-6f5516d8bb677462ea6def46aa65a1094767d68c/> safe_network-0.49.0
 - <csr-id-735a68a45aa264a5462642f4fb1e26f05bdf28ca/> address feedback from pr
   * Remove use of unwrap on topname parsing and put the duplicated code in a function
   * Refer to 'url' rather than 'XorUrl'
 - <csr-id-58632a27d271140fc4d777f25a76b0daea582426/> minor improvement to client log msgs related to configured timeouts

### New Features

 - <csr-id-76fee4674f4a4933c79b90afcd66598e1a05c5fd/> refined ux and behaviour for `nrs add`
   The behaviour for the command is mostly retained, but the user experience has been improved in the
   following ways:
   
   * The documentation for the command and the arguments were elaborated to provide more information.
* Text was added to the command output when the `--default` argument is used, to indicate that a
     link was created to the topname.
* Suggest that links to versionable content must have their version hash specified on the `--link`
     argument.
* The `--name` argument has been renamed to `--public-name`.
* The `--direct` flag argument was removed.

### New Features (BREAKING)

* The `nrs create` command has been renamed to `nrs register`
* The `nrs add` command now has some different names for arguments
* The `node join` command was updated such that you can now pass the genesis key and some other arguments were renamed for clarity
* Various commands were updated to have their error handling and suggestions improved (using the [color_eyre crate](https://docs.rs/color-eyre/latest/color_eyre/))
* The 'self update' feature of the CLI has been disabled for the time being
* The CLI is now compatible with various API updates that have been made

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Blob and Spot entries in the DataType enum are merged into a single Bytes entry.

The client API in the network has now been updated to encapsulate the Blob and Spot data. This makes
the client API much easier to use, as callers no longer need to be concerned about the size of the
data they're trying to store and retrieve.

This was tested against v0.33.12 of `safe_network`.

* update cli for 0.38.x of sn_api ([487e0ab](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/commit/487e0ab1a5af333377b3743cafb74b7551846621))

### Test

 - <csr-id-6f0501699b0d0620a7c9d2b013944f90884ca1c3/> adding first set of tests for Multimap API
 - <csr-id-7fb6bd96a8bdaaee64592b5dc02596b9f6220165/> adapt wallet tests and minor refactoring
 - <csr-id-774694795114dc392db5219393fa63f204fcc905/> adapt tests to new transfer costs and minor refactor to transfers errors handling

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-578d9054c668dcf5871cdac26f2c16aa5df13d58/> parse different output from `nrs create`
   This command now returns a `Url`, along with a tuple of 3 strings. The strings are:
   * a "+" sign to indicate the addition of new content
   * the NRS name that was created
   * the Safe URL the entry points to
   
   The test helper function that parses the output of the command was updated to return these types and
   any callers were updated to use a `Url` directly. Previously, the caller was expecting the Url back
   as a `String`, and most were then creating a `Url` from that `String`, so this cuts the
   intermediate step.
 - <csr-id-25ad76bc374e461c1df786def45ca79bd1f7484a/> unit test node run-baby-fleming command
   I wanted to extend the `run-baby-fleming` command to add a new network to the networks list, but
   before doing so, I looked into providing test coverage to the node commands. Currently there are no
   integration tests for these commands. The `node` commands don't really depend on having an existing
   network, so they are much more susceptible to being unit tested.
   
   The one barrier to unit testing was the fact that the command uses `sn_launch_tool` from the `sn`
   crate, and this actually launches nodes. The solution was to introduce a `NetworkLauncher` trait and
   provide a fake implementation of this trait for use in the unit tests. We use the fake launcher to
   assert that the `sn_launch_tool` is called in the correct fashion. The concrete implementation for
   use with the application was simply just a little wrapper around `sn_launch_tool`.
   
   As part of this refactor, the `run-baby-fleming` command is changed as follows:
   * The `node_path` argument was renamed to `node_dir_path`, to be clearer about the fact that this
     option is expected to be a directory path and not a file path.
   * The `test` flag argument was removed, as we're not using the authentication service just now.
   * The `verbose` flag argument was removed, as it only applied to the authentication service test,
     which was removed.
   
   Due to the authentication service no longer being in use, the code related to performing a test
   using the service was removed.
   
   The unit tests provided here should give coverage for all the scenarios in `run-baby-fleming`.
 - <csr-id-86910340897256bb4df77b6edaa0f2c9584d6dce/> update cli to use new nrs api
   There are changes here to update the NRS command handlers to use the new API for NRS, and other
   smaller changes for referencing types that had been moved to new modules. This commit also restores
   a function, `get_map_summary`, that was deleted from the `NrsMap` struct. The CLI `cat` and `dog`
   commands still relied on this functionality, so it's been provided as a placeholder for now, just to
   get the CLI to compile.
   
   At this point, the NRS test suite is not passing, because there have been some behavioural changes
   as part of the refactor. Unfortunately, because of the state of the rest of the network just now,
   it's hard to isolate these specific changes to get the tests passing again, as other functionality
   like the `cat` command appear to be broken just now too.
   
   I think it's worth committing this as it is now, with the CLI compiling, then we can come back and
   address the other issues that will get the test suite passing again.
 - <csr-id-5780fd1d6ba480cb775fd66e53e41f02d97b3a94/> moving out safe_url mod as a standalone sn_url crate

 - <csr-id-e814ff3b8c58ae7741938a1c73a22c87ed602883/> simplify authd messages format and serialisation

### Other

 - <csr-id-256c504e49121fa0550ae1bcff33f22b8efc78df/> cross platform support for cli unit tests
   On Windows, some tests were failing due to issues with file paths and around URL parsing.
   
   For the files tests, it was because strings were being compared rather than `Path` structs.
   
   For the URL related failures, somewhat strangely, on Windows, the `parse` function on the `url`
   crate returned an `Ok` result if you gave it a file path, which it doesn't do on Linux. A quick
   solution was to test the URL for a host.
 - <csr-id-ae19a45f58bf8d107eea8560af17801d2f619626/> ignore for bugs that have been identified
   There are various tests that are ignored here, where genuine bugs or behavioural changes have been
   identified. These need to be investigated and fixed. Wherever an ignore has been used, a short piece
   of text has been applied to state the issue.
   
   The reason for ignoring them was to see whether the rest of the test suite could run with
   consistency, to see if the frequency of intermittent errors had reduced. We will be looking into
   each of the issues shortly, and as they are fixed, the ignore attributes can be removed.
 - <csr-id-06fda580250745abbd8a6a12bab19c05a61f5615/> minor changes for out of date tests
   A few things were changed here:
   * Use correct method to parse output from `nrs create` commands.
   * Update expectations for minor changes in error messages.
   * Change a couple of tests to not use JSON output, which also seems to have some minor changes.
   * Test data references
   
   For some of these things, like the error messages, it was easier to just have the tests change
   rather than the code, since the differences were so minor.
 - <csr-id-d8ec5a81ae566e8d7068592e01cff4e808b1cad1/> revert "chore(release): safe_network-0.42.0/sn_api-0.41.0"
   This reverts commit 63432eb2e528401ae67da8eea0c82837ab42fc18.
   
   This release was duplicating everything that was in 0.41.0, probably because the tags weren't
   correct.
 - <csr-id-a4e6bb9646521585e2d166fcbc072f43740d1000/> update S3 connection info URL
 - <csr-id-304a16d443a0347e50e0868057486d1067a37b4a/> add details about the new networks set command

 - <csr-id-e107e1314957053db2d71357450cac65cba52a68/> updating CLI User Guide

### Chore

 - <csr-id-05f6d98cf21f0158f4b5161484c7c15a0561b6f4/> clippy tidyup for rust 1.57
 - <csr-id-3f77429e8bd659a5b2e7aa377437fac1b3d709c0/> unify skip port forwarding arguments
   We decided to rename the `--skip-igd` argument to `--skip-auto-port-forwarding`. I had initially
   renamed the arguments on the CLI and `sn_launch_tool` to `--disable-port-forwarding`, but it turned
   out that wasn't a completely accurate description of what's happening.
   
   We are now uniformly referring to this argument as `--skip-auto-port-forwarding`, which is quite an
   accurate description, as it skips (but not disables) the software-based port forwarding, leaving you
   to 'manually' setup port forwarding on your router, if need be.
   
   Also fixed some clippy warnings.

   The first step after the initial merge was to reorganise some directories:
   
   * The cli code was moved from the top level `src` to the `sn_cli` crate directory
   * The test data and related directories were moved to the `resources` directory
   * The test scripts were also moved to the `resources` directory
   
   The CLI integration tests were updated to refer to the new test data locations. Most of the test
   suite is now passing, but some NRS related tests weren't working, so these were marked as ignored.
   These failures look to be due to some of the recent changes in the NRS refactor and will probably be
   quite straight forward to fix. However, I'm going to address these after this merge.

   This is something that makes sense from a UX point of view, but it can also make it easier to use
   some automation to add extra nodes to the network in an automated process that tries to get a local
   network to settle to having 7 Elders, which is required to use some functionality for the network.
   With the `baby-fleming` network added, it can be used as part of the `node join` command.

   previously using a hard-coded placeholder value.
   
   This isn't actually just a feature commit, it's also a refactor to make the command unit-testable
   using the `NetworkLauncher` trait. Unit test coverage has been provided for all the code paths
   in the command. More elaborate documentation has also been provided for each of the arguments for
   the command.
   
   In addition to the unit tests, I've tested the command for joining a local and a remote network,
   both of which were successful.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Multimap entries for NRS will be assigned a different data type when they are
created.

Note, the breaking change relates to the previous commit. For some reason the workflow for updating
the version and deploying a new release didn't trigger.

This commit and PR is just to try and force a new release.
* Multimap entries for NRS will be assigned a different data type when they are
created.

Updates to the latest version of sn_api and also removes the ignore attribute from NRS tests, since
the new version of the API has a fix for NRS issues.

* force new release with readme update ([99c3760](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/commit/99c37603ba5ab80fac27e7a4752df71376ee16ff))
* upgrade sn_api to 0.37.0 ([9da8a77](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/commit/9da8a77cfca5eb99ef4cea6d38de856408624537))

## [0.36.0](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/compare/v0.35.0...v0.36.0) (2021-10-04)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* This is to facilitate the new way that files are stored on the network, which
was updated to support changes in self encryption.

The `files get` command was updated to support the Spot data type.

There were some misc test updates to support these new changes:
* All test runs were updated to use a single thread, since multi threading seemed to result in more
  failures.
* A new cat test case was added for checking the retrieval of spot files.
* Files tests were updated to support the addition of a new large file in the test data.
* Files tests were updated for new file counts upon addition of the new test data file.

Right now, all tests relating to NRS have been marked as ignore, as there is some kind of problem
with NRS. This will be investigated shortly and once it's resolved, these tests will be re-enabled.

### Features

* support retrieval of spots ([348ebda](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/commit/348ebda6f1aedad61c84773ec4cf4e3cfab9ab00))

## [0.35.0](https://github.com/maidsafe/sn_cli/compare/v0.34.0...v0.35.0) (2021-09-28)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* the `network set` command now has different arguments.

The `network set` command creates a new network in the configuration, that has a name and a set of
nodes. Now that we require a genesis key to connect to a network, a genesis key argument was created
for the command.

Test coverage has been added for this change and also to various other parts of the `Config` struct.
They've been added as unit style tests rather than to the integration suite, because these commands
are fairly simple and don't require a full integration test. The coverage is mostly on the `Config`
struct rather than the commands, because the `add` and `set` commands basically just call
`Config::add_network` and it would be quite wasteful and a bit of a maintenance issue to cover both.
One test was created for the `set` command just to make sure it correctly maps its arguments onto
the `add_network`.

Some refactoring took place to make testing a bit easier. The `Config::read` function was changed to
a constructor that accepted both the CLI config file path and the default node config path. This
gives us the ability to pass temporary file paths that are created with `assertfs`, meaning we're not
working with user profile directories when the tests are run on a someone's development machine. Any
command handlers that used the `Config::read` function were updated to accept a reference to a
`Config` as a parameter. The `Config` can be created in the CLI config, and that's where we can pass
in the real profile directory parameters.

The `NetworkInfo` enum entries were renamed from Addresses -> NodeConfig and ConnInfoURL ->
ConnInfoLocation. Since the addition of the genesis key, the network info was no longer just a set
of addresses, and in terms of the connection info, that could be either a URL or a file path, so it
made more sense to name that a bit more generally.
