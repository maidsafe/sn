  # At first glance, it seems like it would be possible to check the commit message in the `if` condition
  # for the presence of the crate name, by using `contains`. However, this doesn't work, so the commit
  # message needs to be checked at the point of publishing. The reason is because of the dependencies
  # between the publishing jobs. If one of the jobs doesn't run because its `if` condition was evaluated
  # to false, the next job won't run, regardless of whether its `if` condition would evaluate to true.
