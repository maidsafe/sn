Absolute links are supported and must be tested, however it is problematic to
check them into git repo because no paths are guaranteed to be present on all
systems, so they could be a valid link on machine A but invalid on machine B.

For this reason, test cases for valid absolute-path links generate the
links themselves inside the system temp directory. See integration tests for
details.
