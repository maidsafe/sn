### New Features

 - <csr-id-16bb3389cdd665fe9a577587d9b7a6e8d21a3028/> exposing a gRPC interface on safenode bin/app
   - The safenode RPC service is exposed only when built with 'rpc-service' feature.
   - The safenode RPC service code is generated automatically using gRPC (`tonic` crate)
   from a `proto` file with messages definitions added to sn_interface.
   - The RPC is exposed at the same address as the node's address used for network connections,
   but using the subsequent port number.
   - A new final step was implemented for the sn_testnet tool, to run a check on the launched nodes,
   verifying their names and network knowledge are the expected for the launched testnet.
   - The new sn_testnet tool step is run only if built with 'verify-nodes' feature.
   - Running the `verify-nodes` check of sn_testnet in CI previous to sn_client e2e tests.

    - Fix(testnet): move os cond. to if-clause body - Running cargo clippy on win machine was borked with the conditional over an error in a fn, as the following code became unreachable. - Placing it in the if clause body removes this clippy error, as the rest of the code in that can still be executed if the flame arg was not set.

<csr-id-1c621d13b5edfc21ed85da7498d24c5db038795a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-4f04bd1a5d1c747bfc6b5d39824dd108f8546b7b/> rename testnet crate to sn_testnet
   Even though the `testnet` crate name is not taken on crates.io, I think it makes sense to prefix
   this crate with `sn_`, as per our other crates. The name of the binary does not change. This crate
   needs to be published because `sn_client` has a dependency on it.
   
   This also provides a README for the crate, which was necessary to have it published.

### Other

 - <csr-id-1c621d13b5edfc21ed85da7498d24c5db038795a/> temporarily prevent workflows running
   I want to temporarily disable the version bump and release workflows from running so that I can
   manually publish the new testnet crate and delete the tags from the last bad release.
