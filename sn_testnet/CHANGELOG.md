## v0.1.0 (2023-03-16)

<csr-id-4f04bd1a5d1c747bfc6b5d39824dd108f8546b7b/>
<csr-id-1c621d13b5edfc21ed85da7498d24c5db038795a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-4f04bd1a5d1c747bfc6b5d39824dd108f8546b7b/> rename testnet crate to sn_testnet
   Even though the `testnet` crate name is not taken on crates.io, I think it makes sense to prefix
   this crate with `sn_`, as per our other crates. The name of the binary does not change. This crate
   needs to be published because `sn_client` has a dependency on it.
   
   This also provides a README for the crate, which was necessary to have it published.

### Other

 - <csr-id-1c621d13b5edfc21ed85da7498d24c5db038795a/> temporarily prevent workflows running
   I want to temporarily disable the version bump and release workflows from running so that I can
   manually publish the new testnet crate and delete the tags from the last bad release.
