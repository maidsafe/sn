### Chore

 - <csr-id-ed26bc19831a28e2e13f63c77d26e0cd086cf85c/> manually bump sn_interface and sn_node
   These crates already have published versions at 0.20.6 and 0.78.6, so reverting the commits didn't
   work correctly for these.
   
   Also temporarily disabling the release and merge workflows again because I don't want to trigger a
   release before I tag these manually.

   The genesis node will output a network contact file which contains its
   own address. This public address was specified by a separate flag but
   was removed, making the genesis incapable of producing a proper contacts
   file. This changes the `--first` flag to be used to pass in that public
   address, which should be done for all genesis nodes, so the proper
   external address can be advertised.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-cee5c65a1a099606d5430452995d26edfd1f6bfc/> leave out reachability check for join
   This reachability check tries to reply/reach out to the node that could
   not connect, but we only save incoming connections, so this will not
   make it out to the node.
   
   Also, the reachability check was left out of the last release of qp2p,
   as the network should not only rely on these reachability checks, but
   the nodes should be unable to join the network anyway if they're not
   reachable in the first place.
 - <csr-id-f779144986a6b2b06f550d3a2a4cbc39c64af83d/> idle_timeout from 10s to 70s
   This was the timeout before this pull request. 70s was deduced to be a
   value that gave CI the time to pass many tests. Although this value is
   not optimal in a real world scenario, as routers might close the holes
   where the connections rely on, and thus the connections will actually
   timeout sooner in some cases. An optimal value was previously decided to
   be 18s, as some routers supposedly close holes after 20s.
 - <csr-id-47e0f87d5ccad33cfa82ef80f3648fe8270acaaa/> remove passing parameters to qp2p
   Rely on defaults in qp2p instead, which are sensible. This means the
   idle timeout from now on will be 10s which is currently the default in
   quinn too.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9ef9a2f2c8711895b62b82d25cb9d208c464cad6/> implement new qp2p version
   This introduces quite some changes to the API that hopefully simplifies
   much of the internals of the node and client.

   - We now use Comm::sessions as the list of members we keep sessions with,
   which is updated only when the user wants to update the set of known peers.
   - Removing unnecessary PeerSession's SessionStatus, disconnect fn, and SessionCmd.
   - Never remove sessions from Comm::sessions unless the set of known members is
   updated/changed by the user. Even if we failed to send using all peer session's connections,
   we keep the session since it's been set as a known and connectable peer.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-b6ee82b6f5abf129e3e0d84e60e15272479e0db2/> remove ConnectionEvents and listener
   They are no longer needed.
   Instead we listen to incoming msgs only, but do not keep
   any incoming connections at all. So nothing to clean up
   there now.
 - <csr-id-61d2bc2d35e3f829d58af736a722d01cd86864b6/> only cache connections created by us
 - <csr-id-783d62461a65eb7c06b0d4f399b97216b6c75519/> sn_interface-0.16.14/sn_client-0.77.8/sn_node-0.72.25/sn_api-0.75.4/sn_cli-0.68.5
 - <csr-id-95ae6f9e8e30184a24465a35626288af64d7995e/> add Peer to UnknownPeer conn Err
 - <csr-id-b8dbee25acfd5b0f348f06419f8058742f575953/> remove Option around send watcher
 - <csr-id-dbfa4ac0dd23e76060b8df44c4666a30bb9b317f/> replace node comms with sn_comms
 - <csr-id-a86d5ad1f352c9000488197ece8edb716941d601/> make a new crate for comm

### Chore

 - <csr-id-0ab0c302dcc6ce32b0b71d696b0707a2c50cfa3a/> sn_comms-0.1.1/sn_node-0.72.26
 - <csr-id-12a6620525a5767d906037a74caf0e38af3da596/> rename update_members to update_valid_comm_targets for clarity

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b5e57d5b3d91849074a90f5ba671d9b19b7e4461/> prohibit creating PeerSession to unkown node
 - <csr-id-3d8070155bb88b7403ae97730b33510b8c3af685/> introducing Cmd::SendNodeMsgResponse for NodeMsg responses to nodes over streams
   - Having this internal sn_node::Cmd to handle sending msg responses to nodes over
   a response bi-stream allows us to decouple such logic from the rest, but it also
   allows us to have unit tests within sn_node which verify the outcome of processing
   Cmds without sending any msg over the wire.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-28cdebb4b05c5d64dcbe8dfb39a72c88fd2c28bd/> update comm members on AE msg in
 - <csr-id-0cbcc1dddf7db229b7fb81328108a076263343d2/> handle sending msgs off the incoming msg loop
   This should prevent us blocking qp2p should a channel itself be blocked

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9aaf91bfedd9fcf040f18e0762ff2cbbc03b4d6f/> forward client data cmds/queries to holders through Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse
   - Unifying and simplifying logic to send client data cmds and queries to holders so in both
   cases the sn_node `Cmd::SendMsgAndAwaitResponse` is used.
   - Renaming `sn_comms::Error::CmdSendError` to `SendError` since it's not specific for
   cmds but for any msg.
   - Some internal sn_node helper functions were moved to different files/mods so they are closer
   to the logic making use of them.
