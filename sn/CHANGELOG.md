## v0.44.4 (2021-11-30)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d2c352198c0e421cf4b7327a17c4343dc693b2dd/> start a fresh round of joins when aggregation is erroring.
   Aggregation may error, perhaps due to section churn. If we half or more bad signaturs that would prevent aggregation. We clean the slate and start a fresh round of aggregation and join messaging.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-758661d87edfef0fee6676993f1e96b3fd2d26bb/> don't crash node on failed signature aggregation on join
 - <csr-id-b79e8d6dbd18a4a0787d326a6b10146fa6b90f30/> retry joins on section key mismatch.
   We could sometimes get a key sent from nodes with a newer section_pk
   than we were expecting.
   
   We should then retry

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0e505be2f57ab427cd3ed8c9564fd8b84909f6f3/> restore `ServiceMsg` authority check
   The `AuthorityProof` struct is designed to be a proof of valid
   authority, by ensuring all possible constructors either generate or
   validate a signature. This can only be guaranteed if the field remains
   module-private. At some point it seems the field was made `pub(crate)`,
   which meant we were missing an authority check for some `ServiceMsg`s,

## v0.41.0 (2021-11-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f29c94d7dfab2e82b9db70fcfeddc4a71d987abb/> use AE to progress various intra-DKG phases
   sometimes a DKG session might receive DKG messages from a further phase
   that it has not reached yet. eg. it might receive Proposal messages
   while in the Initialization phase. When this happens, the DKG can
   respond with a DkgNotReady message to the message source which will sent
   a list of 'DKG Messages' that can be applied to an existing DKG process
   so it can progress to the next phase.
   
   note that this does not solve the case where the DKG session has not yet
   started. that will need to be handled separately. they are currently
   pushed to the backlog and handled later
 - <csr-id-46ea542731fa3e2cede4ce9357783d3681434643/> allow ELDER_COUNT to be overridden by env var SN_ELDER_COUNT
 - <csr-id-f6a3f78156b9cc0f934c19e5d4c0004238a593e4/> verify and use SAP received in AE-Redirect to update client's network knowledge
 - <csr-id-ae5fc40e29161652306b2e42b92d2a80fc746708/> verify and use SAP received in AE-Redirect to update our network knowledge

## v0.40.0 (2021-11-15)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b8b0097ac86645f0c7a7352f2bf220279068228c/> support `--json-logs` in `testnet`
   This makes it easier to enable JSON logs for local testnets.
 - <csr-id-044fd61950be76e3207694094dcec81313937403/> allow to change the default interval for testnet nodes

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ad633e1b6882db1aac0cb1a530300d9e4d666fd8/> avoid holding write lock on ae_backoff_cache during sleep
   This could inadvertently be slowing down other joins if we're holding the write lock on the cache while we backoff
 - <csr-id-366ad9a42034fe450c30908d372fede0ff92f655/> draining backlog before process DKG message
 - <csr-id-c4a42fb5965c79aaae2a0ef2ae62fcb987c37525/> less DKG progression interval; switch SAP on DKGcompletion when OurElder already received
 - <csr-id-adf9feac964fb7f690bd43aeef3270c82fde419c/> fix `Eq` for `SectionPeers`
   This would have always returned true, since it was comparing with
   itself...

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9b8ddfde0287e47b6f18a77a8e8847d80ee84bcd/> provide the SAP proof chain in JoinResponse::Retry msgs
   - Joining node now makes use of the NetworkPrefixMap to validate and
   accept new SAPs using the proof chain provided in JoinResponse::Retry.

### refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ee165d41ca40be378423394b6422570d1d47727c/> duplicate `SectionAuthorityProvider` in `routing`
   This is part of the move towards passing connection handles through
   network knowledge. Whilst it would be possible to put a connection
   handle in the `messaging` struct, and just skip it when (de)serialising,
   this seems less clean than having a separate struct.
 - <csr-id-00acf0c0d8a65bdd5355ba909d73e74729a27044/> move `SectionPeers` from `messaging` to `routing`
   `SectionPeers` was only used in the `SystemMsg::AntiEntropyUpdate`
   message. Rather than simply inlining the `DashMap`, it's been replaced
   by `BTreeSet<SectionAuth<NodeState>>` since the map keys are redundant
   with the `name` field of `NodeState` (and `BTreeSet` specifically for
   deterministic ordering).
   
   With the move, it's also become `pub(crate)`, so from the perspective of
   the public API this type has been removed.
 - <csr-id-7d5d5e11fef39a6dc1b89c972e42772db807374c/> move `ElderCandidates` to `routing`
   The `ElderCandidate` type was in `messaging`, and was only used in the
   `SystemMsg::DkStart` message. It was more commonly used as network
   state, so homing it in `routing::network_knowledge` makes more sense.
   This also means the type no longer needs to be public, and doesn't need
   to be (de)serialisable, which opens up the possibility of putting more
   stuff in it in future (e.g. connection handles...).
   
   As a first step down that road, the `elders` field now contains `Peer`s
   rather than merely `SocketAddr`s. The majority of reads of the field
   ultimately want either name-only or `Peer`s, so this seems reasonable
   regardless.
 - <csr-id-855b8ff87217e92a5f7d55fb78ab73c9d81f75a2/> make `SectionAuthorityProviderUtils` `pub(crate)`
   This shouldn't really be part of the public API, and having it such
   transitively grows the visibility of its collaborators (e.g.
   `ElderCandidates`) which also don't need to be in the public API.
 - <csr-id-23b8a08e97fa415b9216caac5da18cb97ede980f/> remove `Copy` from `Peer`
   Eventually we may want to put a `Connection` into `Peer`, which is not
   `Copy`. As such, `Peer` itself will be unable to derive `Copy`. Although
   this might not happen for a while, removing dependence on `Copy` now
   will make it smoother when the time comes.

## v0.39.0 (2021-11-12)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b8b0097ac86645f0c7a7352f2bf220279068228c/> support `--json-logs` in `testnet`
   This makes it easier to enable JSON logs for local testnets.
 - <csr-id-044fd61950be76e3207694094dcec81313937403/> allow to change the default interval for testnet nodes

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-366ad9a42034fe450c30908d372fede0ff92f655/> draining backlog before process DKG message
 - <csr-id-c4a42fb5965c79aaae2a0ef2ae62fcb987c37525/> less DKG progression interval; switch SAP on DKGcompletion when OurElder already received
 - <csr-id-adf9feac964fb7f690bd43aeef3270c82fde419c/> fix `Eq` for `SectionPeers`
   This would have always returned true, since it was comparing with
   itself...

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9b8ddfde0287e47b6f18a77a8e8847d80ee84bcd/> provide the SAP proof chain in JoinResponse::Retry msgs
   - Joining node now makes use of the NetworkPrefixMap to validate and
   accept new SAPs using the proof chain provided in JoinResponse::Retry.

### refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ee165d41ca40be378423394b6422570d1d47727c/> duplicate `SectionAuthorityProvider` in `routing`
   This is part of the move towards passing connection handles through
   network knowledge. Whilst it would be possible to put a connection
   handle in the `messaging` struct, and just skip it when (de)serialising,
   this seems less clean than having a separate struct.
 - <csr-id-00acf0c0d8a65bdd5355ba909d73e74729a27044/> move `SectionPeers` from `messaging` to `routing`
   `SectionPeers` was only used in the `SystemMsg::AntiEntropyUpdate`
   message. Rather than simply inlining the `DashMap`, it's been replaced
   by `BTreeSet<SectionAuth<NodeState>>` since the map keys are redundant
   with the `name` field of `NodeState` (and `BTreeSet` specifically for
   deterministic ordering).
   
   With the move, it's also become `pub(crate)`, so from the perspective of
   the public API this type has been removed.
 - <csr-id-7d5d5e11fef39a6dc1b89c972e42772db807374c/> move `ElderCandidates` to `routing`
   The `ElderCandidate` type was in `messaging`, and was only used in the
   `SystemMsg::DkStart` message. It was more commonly used as network
   state, so homing it in `routing::network_knowledge` makes more sense.
   This also means the type no longer needs to be public, and doesn't need
   to be (de)serialisable, which opens up the possibility of putting more
   stuff in it in future (e.g. connection handles...).
   
   As a first step down that road, the `elders` field now contains `Peer`s
   rather than merely `SocketAddr`s. The majority of reads of the field
   ultimately want either name-only or `Peer`s, so this seems reasonable
   regardless.
 - <csr-id-855b8ff87217e92a5f7d55fb78ab73c9d81f75a2/> make `SectionAuthorityProviderUtils` `pub(crate)`
   This shouldn't really be part of the public API, and having it such
   transitively grows the visibility of its collaborators (e.g.
   `ElderCandidates`) which also don't need to be in the public API.
 - <csr-id-23b8a08e97fa415b9216caac5da18cb97ede980f/> remove `Copy` from `Peer`
   Eventually we may want to put a `Connection` into `Peer`, which is not
   `Copy`. As such, `Peer` itself will be unable to derive `Copy`. Although
   this might not happen for a while, removing dependence on `Copy` now
   will make it smoother when the time comes.

 - <csr-id-6eb389acfb3adcec0be07ee990106ed19a7f78f5/> make `KvStore::store` perform atomic immutable writes
   `KvStore` is the database abstraction we use to persist chunks. This is
   itself backed by `sled`. `sled` uses a log as one of the underlying
   storage primitives, which means that all inserts (even overwrites) will
   consume additional space (until the log is compacted, which may happen
   irregularly).
   
   However, chunks themselves are write-once which means that we would only
   ever need to write a value once. As such, we can use `compare_and_swap`
   to write the value only if it's not currently set. Since chunks are
   content-addressable, we furthermore don't need to do anything if the
   value did already exist and wasn't written, since there is only one
   possible value for a given key.
 - <csr-id-b53a86b9ba0bfb33ab9cccaecb383bcce0acf233/> fix test for `GetChunk` 'data not found' failures
   `QueryResponse::failed_with_data_not_found` is used to prevent sending
   'data not found' errors to clients. Clients, in turn, do not retry
   errors, only timeouts.
   
   Recently (c0b1770154) the error type returned when a chunk is not found
   was changed from `NoSuchData` to `ChunkNotFound`, but the check in
   `failed_with_data_not_found` was not updated. This could lead to
   spurious client errors when they attempt to read data before it is
   available (which would otherwise be covered by the retry on timeout,
   since nodes would not forward the data-not-found response).

   `client::connections::Session::make_contact_with_nodes` would slice the
   known initial contacts, but this would panic if fewer than
   `NODES_TO_CONTACT_PER_STARTUP_BATCH` (currently: 3) nodes are known.
   It's not clear that this is a precondition or requirement, so for now we
   simply take as many as we can up to
   `NODES_TO_CONTACT_PER_STARTUP_BATCH`. If it *is* a requirement, we
   should return an `Err` rather than panic.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-06b57d587da4882bfce1b0acd09faf9129306ab2/> add log markers for connection open/close
   We can detect connection open/close easily in the connection listener
   tasks, since these are started as soon as a connection is opened, and
   finish when there are no more incoming connections (e.g. connection has
   closed).
 - <csr-id-20895dd4326341de4d44547861ac4a57ae8531cf/> the JoinResponse::Retry message now provides the expected age for the joining node

### refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-61dec0fd90b4df6b0695a7ba46da86999d199d4a/> remove `SectionAuthorityProviderUtils::elders`
   Since the `elders` field of `SectionAuthorityProvider` is public, this
   method is essentially equivalent to `sap.elders.clone()`. Furthermore,
   it was barely used (5 call sites).
 - <csr-id-49c76d13a91474038bd8cb005959a37a7d4c6603/> tweak `Peer` API
   `Peer`'s fields are no longer public, and the `name` and `addr` methods
   return owned (copied) values. There's no point in having both a public
   field and a getter, and the getters were used far more often. The
   getters have been changed to return owned values, since `XorName` and
   `SocketAddr` are both `Copy`, so it seems reasonable to avoid the
   indirection of a borrow.
 - <csr-id-c5d2e31a5f0cea381bb60dc1f896dbbda5038506/> remove `PeerUtils` trait
   This trait has been redundant since the `sn_messaging` and `sn_routing`
   crate were merged, but it's doubly so when the `Peer` struct is now
   itself in `routing`.
 - <csr-id-0cb790f5c3712e357f685bfb88cd237c5b5f76c5/> move `Peer` from `messaging` to `routing`
   The `Peer` struct no longer appears in any message definitions, and as
   such doesn't belong in `messaging`. It has been moved to `routing`,
   which is the only place it's now used.
   
   The derive for `Deserialize` and `Serialize` have also been removed from
   `Peer`, since they're no longer needed.
 - <csr-id-b3ce84012e6cdf4c87d6d4a3137ab6506264e949/> remove `Peer` from `NodeState`
   Syntactially, having a "peer" struct inside `NodeState` doesn't make a
   lot of sense, vs. including the name and address directly in the state.
   This also unblocks moving `Peer` out of `messaging`, which will remove
   the requirement for it to be serialisable etc.
   
   To make migration easier, an `age` method was added to the
   `NodeStateUtils` trait.
 - <csr-id-ecf0bc9a9736167edb15db7ff4e3cf5dc388dd22/> remove `reachable` from `messaging::system::Peer`
   Although the field is `false` on initialisation, and it is checked in a
   couple of places, in every case as far as I can tell it is set to `true`
   right after construction. As such, it's not really doing anything for us
   and we can remove it.
